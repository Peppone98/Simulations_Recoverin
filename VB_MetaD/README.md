I have to write the best input file ever. it has to capture all the relevant quantities in the simulation. 

Be careful in the definition of the restraint. You also have to carry out simulations with the membrane system, so you should be able to replicate the same restraint. 

1. Should the sphere be centred around the CM of the protein or should it be slightly shifted? This problem is not relevant for the protein in aqueous environment, but it is crucial for the protein in membrane.
