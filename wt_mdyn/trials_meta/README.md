# Metadynamics attempts 

This folders contains some attempts in which I imposed a wrong harmonic wall restraint at a distance of 1.3 nm. The distance is still between the CM of the coordinating oxygens and the calcium ion. 

The results of the simulations can be found inside the folder `wall_meta`.
