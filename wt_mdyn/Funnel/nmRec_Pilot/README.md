# Pilot metadynamics 

The aim is to start an aggressive metadynamics in order to generate 8 different configurations for the definitive MW metadynamics.  

I generate the `.tpr` in this folder using the ff and the topology files. 

I take the same input files stored in `nmRec_rmsd`, with a slightly higher height and biasfactor. 

# Use VMD for the RMSD
Just put `name CA C N O` and remember to select the right molecule.
