# Folder of the definitive funnel metadynamics 

I generated the `.dat` files in the previous folder `funnel_pilot`. I must generate the `.tpr` files from the 8 frames collected in the folder `frames_center`. 

Small side note: because of the problem of the simulation 7 (unexplicably looking outside the grid according to plumed), I decided to replicate the folder WALKER6.
