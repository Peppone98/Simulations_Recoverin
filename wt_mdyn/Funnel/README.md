This idea comes from a fruitful conversation with Alessio :)

The problem is that the $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ ion does not completely detach from the protein during the simulations. Instead, it interacts with other residues outside the pocket and never leaves the protein. This effect is due to the wall I implemented at 1.3 nm. This prevents $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ from detaching. I wanted 


Alessio said that it could be helpful to simulate the same metadynamics run using the coarse-grained system. In this way, we would obtain a comparison with the atomistic run

One idea is to collect the positions explored by the $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ ion. 

Another idea is to obtain a 2D map.

Thanks to Paulo da Souza, it looks that myristoyl group has been represented in a CG. 


Maybe a could remove the walls from a certain point and go ahead with the multiple walkers simulations. Then I have to reweight all the preceding frames with the correct weight. The problem is that $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ might have already interacted with other residues and the presence of the wall might have modified the path a normal metadynamics would have produced. 


In the case of umbrella sampling, we pass from the bound state to a the unbound one at approximately 0.8-1 nm, which is a very short distance. I don√¨t think that $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ has already completely detached from the protein at that distance. 



In case you want to use plumed on cluster, just do
```
module load gcc91
module load openmpi-3.0.0
module load BLAS
module load gsl-2.5
module load lapack-3.7.0
module load python-3.8.13 
source /home/giuseppe.gambini/usr/src/gmx_plumed.sh
```

# Funnel metadynamics
We have to introduce the funnel restraint of the system under study, which is done with the graphical user interface implemented in VMD. 

The funnel restraint should should be placed on the system so as to include the ligand binding site in the cone section of the funnel. 

- The points A and B represent the extremes of the funnel cone.
- `Zcc` defines the switching point between the cone and the cylindric section of the funnel. 
- `alpha` defines the amplitude of the conic region, in radians. 
- `Rcyl` is the radius of the cylindric section. 

The funnel volume in orange represents the space that will be sampled by the center of mass of the ligand. The script `ffs.tcl` is a post processing script. To open the graphical interface, type `ffs_tk`.
