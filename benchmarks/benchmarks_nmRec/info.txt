SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE BENCHMARKS


- Walltime: 5 minutes
- Queue: short_cpuQ


Simulated system: 
- Non-myristoylated Recoverin (without the peptide GRK1) in complex with two Calcium ions
- .gro file: rec_r_nm_solv_ions.gro
- Number of atoms: 59330
- Dimensions of the box: [7.34900   8.20900  10.06600]



Parameters of the short metadynamics simulations:
- CV: distance between COM of coordinant oxygens and Ca2+ ion
- Pace of deposition of the Gaussian: every 100 steps (which correspond to 0.2 ps)
- Height of the Gaussians: 1.2 kJ/mol
- Standard deviation sigma: 0.007 (deduced from the unbiased simulations)
- Bias factor: 8


Observations:
- The pace of deposition of the Gaussian is very quick since I wanted to test the communication between GROMACS and PLUMED
- As a rule of thumb, the height is normally chosen as kT/2
- Usually the bias factor is in the range [5, 10]
