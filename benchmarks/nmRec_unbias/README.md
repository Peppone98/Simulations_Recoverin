# Benchmarks

In this folder we collect the starting files for the benchmark. The plan is to make benchmarks on the short_cpuQ queue (which is the fastest). We need to collect the performances of different runs and show them in a python notebook. 

## Setting up the `.dat` file for plumed
We need to collect the distances between the six coordinating Oxygens and the Calcium ion. The six atoms are: `ASP74 OD2`, `ASN76 OD1`, `ASP78 OD2`, `THR80 O`, `GLU85 OE1`, `GLU85 OE2`. We need to compute the distance of these atoms with `301CAL`.
