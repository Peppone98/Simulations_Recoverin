# Collection of Well-Tempered (WT) Metadynamics (Mdyn)

Here we collect all eight simulations, with and without the membrane. We use the same parameters, barostats and thermostats as Ester used. In this way, we will discover the best method between metadynamics and umbrella sampling. It is very important to set up the right `.tpr` file for all the production runs.
