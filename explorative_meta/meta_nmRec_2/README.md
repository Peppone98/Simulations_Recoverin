# Second run 

Here we present a second metadynamics run with `PACE=1000`. The configurations should be less "stressed" w.r.t. the first case. 


## Reweight
The presence of the metadynamics bias potential has altered the statistical weight of each frame, so we need to reweight in order to explore new possible CVs.

I think that if I reweight the trajectory and then plot the distribution $P(n)$, where $n$ is the coordination number, I should see a very similar profile because $n$ and $d$ (distance EF2-Ca) are highly correlated.
